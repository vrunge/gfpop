Description: Penalized parametric change-point detection by functional pruning dynamic programming algorithm. 
  The successive means are constrained using a graph structure with edges of types null, up, down, std or abs. To each edge we can associate some additional properties: a minimal gap size, a penalty, some robust parameters (K,a). The user can also constrain the inferred means to lie between some minimal and maximal values. Data is modeled by a quadratic cost with possible use of a robust loss, biweight and Huber (see edge parameters K and a). Other losses are also available with log-linear representation or a log-log representation.
